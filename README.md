# Azure DevOps Presentations

Azure DevOps Presentations is a collection of [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) presentations used for training our team members on Azure DevOps, Git, and DevOps in general.

We also use a modified version of [Pike Street Theme](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/Reveal-PikeStreet) for these presentations.

## Installation

These presentations rely on Reveal.js, which requires npm.

First clone this repo, then install all dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm i
```

For more information, see the [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) project

## Usage

You can serve the website after installing npm dependencies using:
```bash
npm start
```
Navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view this presentation.
